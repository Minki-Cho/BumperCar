- When player lose there are screen shaking and making the car transparent.

#  Personal notes

- I was very grateful to my team. I was really exciting. They worked really hard. I'm so proud what we did!
I realized the importance of cooperation and have difficulties during programming, teammates can help each other. Also, they could give an idea which is better than before. I can improve my programming in projects. It was an opportunity to think the game be funnier.
