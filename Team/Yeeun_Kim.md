● Main contributions:
● make assets used in game, make splash screen, record my voice to click sound, make playtest survey.

● Personal notes (optional):
● I learned a lot from this project. learned a lot in class, but there were many things I didn't understand, but I asked my team members and worked on a project together to improve my coding skills and learn teamwork. 
If I had done it alone, I wouldn't have tried things like physical application, but I thought I should work harder when I saw that they tried and succeeded in difficult contents. So I want to say thank you to my team members.
I was also proud that the assets I drew were applied to the game. I was proud to see the game almost complete, and I was even happier because the professor seemed to like our team.
