### Main contributions:

-> Made whole player physics like collision

-> Made technical parts such as set refresh rate to 60 frames per second.

-> Made some states

### Personal notes:

-> In my opinion, my team's teamwork was great for entire development period. Everyone had their own roles, and did well. Also, I enjoyed collaborating with my teammates and making our own game. Nevertheless, I regret a little bit that I could do better on physics even though I did my best. During the team project, I learned how to communicate, some programming tips from teammates like better way of using SFML sound, and namespace. It's entirely a great experience.
